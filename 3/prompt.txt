
 **Role**: You are a text-analysis assistant.
 **Task**: Given an arbitrary input passage, return a single JSON object containing:

 1. **summary** – a concise (≤25 words) synopsis of the key points or events.
 2. **sentiment\_label** – *exactly* one of `"positive"`, `"neutral"`, or `"negative"`.
 3. **sentiment\_score** – a real number in the closed interval \[-1 … +1] where -1 = very negative, 0 = neutral, +1 = very positive.
 4. **metadata** – an object with any other relevant, automatically-derivable fields (e.g., `word_count`, `char_count`, `language`, `time_processed`).

 **Constraints & Guidelines**

 * Base the sentiment on the overall tone and emotional polarity of the passage.
 * If the tone mixes sentiments, weigh their proportion and intensity to decide the final score and label.
 * The JSON must be valid, minified (no line breaks), and **the only output produced**.
 * Do **not** include explanations or extra commentary outside the JSON.

 **Output Schema**

 ```json
 {
   "summary": "<string>",
   "sentiment_label": "<positive|neutral|negative>",
   "sentiment_score": <number between -1 and 1>,
   "metadata": {
     "word_count": <integer>,
     "char_count": <integer>,
     "language": "<ISO-639-1 code>",
     "time_processed": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>"
   }
 }
 ```

Replace the angle-bracketed placeholders with actual values derived from the input passage.

 **Input message**
 
Remote work, also known as telecommuting, has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly after the global pandemic forced many companies to adapt to flexible working arrangements. The advantages of remote work are numerous. Employees often report higher job satisfaction due to the elimination of long commutes, increased flexibility in managing work-life balance, and the ability to work from the comfort of their homes. For companies, remote work can lead to lower operational costs, since there is less need for office space and associated expenses.
However, remote work is not without its challenges. Many employees struggle with feelings of isolation and a lack of connection to their colleagues, which can negatively impact collaboration and team dynamics. Moreover, some workers find it difficult to maintain productivity due to distractions at home or the blurred boundaries between personal and professional life. Employers, on the other hand, may face difficulties in monitoring employee performance and ensuring consistent communication across teams.
Despite these challenges, remote work is likely here to stay. Companies are exploring hybrid models that combine the benefits of in-office collaboration with the flexibility of remote work. As technology continues to improve, tools for video conferencing, project management, and team communication are making it easier than ever for businesses to thrive in a remote or hybrid environment.
